# Module - filesystem

This module is responsible for interacting with filesystem.

It is an extension of original filemanager project called [RichFilemanager](https://github.com/servocoder/RichFilemanager).

Java connector is extended from project [https://github.com/fabriceci/RichFilemanager-JAVA](https://github.com/fabriceci/RichFilemanager-JAVA)

## Running tests
```
mvn clean test
```

## Logging
Logging capability into the specific files provided.

Log files are stored in *logs/* folder

Logging into the files can be achieved by setting maven property

Profile **default** will not print to file.

Profile **dev-info** will print only basic information into the file.

Profile **dev-debug** will print debug information into the file.

```
-Dspring.profiles.active    [default,   dev-info, dev-debug]
```


## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

## Build properties

Here is the list of available properties that can be used to customize build options:

*Default value is represented as first item in array.

```
-Dspring.profiles.active    [default,   dev-info, dev-debug]                            :   Spring logging profile, which is used for saving [INFO or DEBUG] logs into files
-Dmodule.logging.level      [INFO,      DEBUG, ERROR, WARN, TRACE, ALL, OFF, FATAL]     :   Sets console logging level for all module classes
-Dspring.logging.level      [INFO,      DEBUG, ERROR, WARN, TRACE, ALL, OFF, FATAL]     :   Sets console logging level for all spring classes
